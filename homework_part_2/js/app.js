// PART 1:
// 1. The difference between interpolation and
// concatentation: Concatenation allows you to combine to strings 
// together. It only works on strings.  
// Example:  console.log("general " + "assembly");
// Interpolation allows you to combine strings with variables .
// Example:  const num = 5;
// console.log(`they have ${num} pizzas`)


// 2. DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
// Loops are very useful for writing DRY code.

// 3. Declaration of a variable serves two purposes: 
// It associates a type and an identifier (or name) with the variable.
// Assignment is when we give a variable a specific value 
// Defining a variable: Defining a variable means declaring it and 
// also allocating space to hold it.

// 4. Const should be used when we dont need to reassign a 
// value to a variable
// let should be used for variables that need to change values as 
// a part of a later function

// 5. A directory that contains other directories/files
// 6. By using the help commands from within the command line
// 7. Tab completion is an auto-complete feature that exists
// in the command line.  It's awesome because it reduces the
// amount of work needed to get around the computer using 
// only the command line.

// PART 2:
 //const a = 4;
 //const b = 53;
 //const c = 57;
 //const d = 16;
 //const e = 'Kevin';

 // 1. 
 //console.log(a <= b);
 // 2. 
// console.log(c >= d);
 // 3. 
 //console.log('name' == 'name');
 // 4. 
 //console.log(a <= b <= c);
 // 5. 
 //console.log(a === a != d);
 // 6. 
 //console.log(e === 'Kevin');
 // 7. 
 //console.log(48 == '48');

 //PART 3
 // #1
 // yes it's an infinite loop.  
 // The condition will always be true and so it will run forever

 // #2
 // this is an infinite loop
 // because the condition isn't broken despite being redfined as false

// #3
// 20 As should appear

// PART 4

// #1 while loops are better for when one is unsure of how long the
// condition will allow the loop to run.  For loops have a definite 
// number for looping the code.  They both repeat themselves usefully.

// #2 
// for(i = 0; i <= 999; i++){
 //   console.log(i);

//}

// #3
// * let i = 0;  this declares i and sets its value at 0
// * i < 100; this sets a condition for the loop to execute as long as it is true
// * i++ this incrementally increases i (by 1) for every successful loop that occurs

// for(i = 999; i >= 0; i--){
//    console.log(i);
//}

//for(i = 1; i <=10; i++){
    //console.log(`The value of ${i} of 10`);
//}
